A 15 metres wide public slipway
Provides access to the water during most states of the tide
Times with restricted access to the water are one hour either side of low water spring tides. The bottom of the slip is visible when the sea level drops to 1.3 metres above low water spring tides.
As the slip has a relatively gentle slope vehicles may need to reverse into the water for launches in order for the vessel to draw enough draught to float from a trailer. This would make launching any vessels with fixed fin keels difficult. 1.5 metres from the end of the slip there is a ramp with an increased angle.
The slip can prove very popular, with congestion at peak times such as weekends and holiday periods.",www.plymouth.gov.uk/mountbattenmainslipway,248866062,53258207

7 to 8 metres wide ‘L’ shaped public slipway
Provides access to the water during all states of the tide
Access to the water is restricted around low water spring tides
Boats can be launched from trailers for three to four hours either side of high water. However it can be difficult to negotiate the lower section of the L shaped slipway when reversing.",www.plymouth.gov.uk/mountbattennorthwestendslipway,248722622,53370924

A 12 metre wide public slipway
Provides access to the water during most states of the tide
Times with restricted access to the water are at low water spring tides due to the need to cross the bed of the estuary to reach the water.
When launching it is best to keep to the main channel until you are into the Sound, 1.5km downstream, because at low water the Cattewater dries out in places nearer to land.",www.plymouth.gov.uk/orestonslipway,250000605,53566614

A 12 metre wide public slipway
Provides access to the water at most states of the tide
Any times with restricted access to the water: At low water spring tides access is restricted due to the need to cross the bed of the estuary to reach the water.  If launching from a trailer then it is best to avoid the very bottom of spring tides for launching or recovering a boat.",www.plymouth.gov.uk/richmondwalkslipway,245802452,53939268
Saltash Passage slipway,"The slipway is free for public use for the launching of most types of boats including those towed on trailers. As the slope is relatively gentle cars might need to reverse into the water to ensure there is enough draught to float vessels from a trailer which might make launching fixed keel vessels challenging.

A 15 metre wide slipway
Provides access to the water at all states of the tide
There should be no times when access to the water is restricted.
The slip has a gentle slope which means cars may need to reverse into the water to gain enough draught for vessels to float from a trailer and which would make launching fixed fin keel boats challenging.",www.plymouth.gov.uk/saltashpassageslipway,243674172,58643110
